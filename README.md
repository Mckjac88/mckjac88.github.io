Contained in this repo are two projects that I worked on with one of my companions on the mission, the first automatically scraped zillow for information on people who had recently moved into the area (I helped to code a decent portion of this) and the second queried church servers to gather information on members from the Preach My Gospel app in a way that could be pasted into an excel sheet that was created to accompany it (my companion coded the the false root and query formatting but taught me how to replicate it and I set up the sheet and fixed it after an update broke it after he returned from his mission)
